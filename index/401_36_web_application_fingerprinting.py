# Purpose:                      Objectives

# For this lab youâ€™ll need to develop and test your Python script from a Linux VM with the tools Nmap, Netcat, and Telnet installed. Generally speaking, Kali Linux is the recommendation for this challenge.

# In Python create a script that executes from a Linux box to perform the following:

# Prompts the user to type a URL or IP address.
# Prompts the user to type a port number.
# Performs banner grabbing using netcat against the target address at the target port; prints the results to the screen then moves on to the step below.
# Performs banner grabbing using telnet against the target address at the target port; prints the results to the screen then moves on to the step below.
# Performs banner grabbing using Nmap against the target address of all well-known ports; prints the results to the screen.
# NOTE: Be sure to only target approved URLs like scanme.nmap.org or web servers you own.
